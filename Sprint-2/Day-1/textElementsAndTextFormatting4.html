    <h1>I LOOK AT THE WORLD</h1>
    <h3>by LANGSTON HUGHES</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    I look at the world
    From awakening eyes in a black face—And this is what I see:
    This fenced-off narrow space   
    Assigned to me.
    <hr>

    I look then at the silly walls
    Through dark eyes in a dark face—
    And this is what I know:
    That all these walls oppression builds Will have to go!
    <hr>

    I look at my own body   
    With eyes no longer blind—
    And I see that my own hands can make The world that's in my mind.
    Then let us hurry, comrades,
    The road to find.
